      <h1>The Covid19 Pandemic...</h1>
      <p>The World is under the grip of the Covid19 Pandemic and is under a social and economic lockdown. This pandemic has thrown light on the preparedness of humans against such sudden and preexisting virus diseases, followed by the aftermath and crisis that it would lead to.

          In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China. On 31 December 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus, which was given the interim name 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), later renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

     As of 3 May 2020, there have been at least 243,922 confirmed deaths and more than 3,441,767 confirmed cases in the coronavirus pneumonia pandemic. The Wuhan strain has been identified as a new strain of Betacoronavirus from group 2B with approximately 70% genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV. The virus has a 96% similarity to a bat coronavirus, so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well.

      <h3>Pandemic and "Covidology"</h3>
      <p>"Coviodology" stands for Covid19 Pandemic & Psychology . 

Countries are racing to slow the spread of the virus by testing and treating patients, carrying out contact tracing, limiting travel, quarantining citizens, and cancelling large gatherings such as sporting events, concerts, and schools.The pandemic is moving like a waveâ€”one that may yet crash on those least able to cope.

But COVID-19 is much more than a health crisis. By stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political crises that will leave deep scars. Moreover, it casts great concern on the unacknowledged and vulnerable Mental Health of  people.
